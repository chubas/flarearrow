**Flare Arrow** is licensed under GNU GPL 3.0

Under the [Free Software Definition](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), we think of user's four main rights. We are interested in contributing to GNU principles and spread the use and production of Free Software. Hence, we chose the GNU GPL 3.0 license, which allows us to do that.

Also, we think that free software allow the program to reach beyond we can do. That is, as seeing a [comparison between some existing OCaml web frameworks](comparison.md), we spotted that collaboration is low or non-existant between developers. We'd like to encourage certain community interested on this project to continue it and make it better. A GPL licence would allow us to do that.

We intend to release software that is free for everyone. Our development team uses free software because we can learn from it, employ it multiple times, and extend it. We consider GNU GPL a great choice, as a way to contribute to the software community and as a way to help innovation among developers.
